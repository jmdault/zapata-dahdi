Zapata -- Unix-Based High Density Computer Telephony Project

Current computer telephony technologies have 2 main problems: ludicrously
high cost, and ludicrously low support.

When you buy standard commercially-available computer telephony hardware
these days, after having your wallet absolutely raped, you find that the
product is broken, or at least has funny quirks that even the manufacturer
doesn't seem to know about (or care) about, and isn't interested in (or
for that matter capable of) giving you any reasonable level of support.
This is completely consistent (without exception) among all of the major
manufacturers.

There is now finally hope after years of this type of severe dysfunction.

The Zapata project, named after the famous Mexican Revolutionary, is an
attempt to address these issues in a practical and livable manner.

After much experimentation, it was found that it was quite feasible to
achieve somewhat high channel-count density utilizing minimal hardware on
a modern PC-style system, thus minimizing the hardware costs.

In addition, a free open-source architecture running on a solid, stable,
free open-source platform, completely eliminates support issues. This way,
if you don't like what it does or the way it does it, you can 'fix' it
yourself. Unlike many of the commercial manufacturers, we have nothing to
hide or lose by making our technology and source code openly available to
everyone.

The Zapata Technology
=====================

The Zapata technology started with an interface card called "Tormenta".
The project evolved from an ISA board, to PCI, to a whole range of devices.
Once called "Zaptel", the driver interface is now integrated into Asterisk:

The "zapata" library, however, had never been updated in many years and
still required the original "tor/zaptel" driver.

Jean-Michel Dault <jmdault@media5corp.com> resurrected the Zapata library in
2023 by adapting it to use the new DAHDI interface.

The driver and library fully implement all standard telecom functions,
including signaling, DTMF and MF detection and generation, arbitrary single
and dual tone generation, Caller*ID reception (on FXS channels), voice play
and record, switching, and conferencing, yet consumes quite minimal system
resources.

In addition, Zapata fully implements Digital TTY/TDD modems within its
library, making it the first ever multiple-line telecommunications
solution for communicating with Deaf and hearing-impared people on a
large-scale basis. Nothing else has ever even come close (the highest
density devices to date have been single analog line based) at any price.

And it's all freely available as open-source.

Viva la revolucion de las computadoras telefonicas! Viva Zapata!

Installation
============

To install the zapata library under Linux you should perform the following
operations:

1. Install a compatible kernel. Virtually any kernel since 2.4.2 will do.
2. Install a DAHDI-compatible hardware. These are available from Sangoma, Xorcomm, Amfeltec and others. 
3. Install dahdi-linux: https://github.com/asterisk/dahdi-linux
4. Compile this library using "make".
5. There are several test programs that will enable you to simulate incoming and outgoing calls, as well as an answering machine.
